# Datafi Hosted Edge Servers

Edge server is the data control plane in Datafi. For connecting to any data source an Edge Server needs to be deployed and provisioned with credentials and other details of the datasource.

With Datafi Hosted Edge Servers, Datafi will do the heavy lift to deploy and provision edge-server in Datafi's cloud infrastructure. You need to provide credentials of the data-source you are connecting. A Hosted Edge Server can be created by going to Datafi Console (https://home.datafi.us) and click on the button 'Add Dataset'

> To connect your data source using Datafi hosted edge servers it requires direct access from Datafi cloud servers. We use NAT gateways to access the data source which provides a consistent public IP accessing your data source.  For improved security you can limit access to only the outbound IP addresses defined for your workspace. To know the outbound IP address, please contact support.
